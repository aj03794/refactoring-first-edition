###### What is Refactoring?

- Process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure
- Disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs
- You are improving the design of the code after it has been written
- With refactoring you can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed code
- Each step is simple
- You move a field from one class to another, pull some code out of a method to make into its own method, and push some code up or down a hierarchy
- You learn from building the system how to improve the design
